    <h1>Najpiękniejsze Miejsca Na Ziemi</h1>

        <h5>Outer Hebrides, Scotland</h5>
        <p>Scattered along Scotland's west coast, this chain of isles is one of the country's most beautiful places to visit. Think shimmering white-sand beaches, sparkling seas and crowd-free hinterlands – it's one of the UK's last remaining secrets, and for good reason.</p>
    </div>

        <h5>Douro Valley, Portugal</h5>
        <p>With endless rows of vines tumbling down hillsides and birds of prey swooping along the riverside, at first glance you'd think this place was anywhere but Europe. Right in the depths of Portugal, this valley is as romantic as it comes – hike along ridges, taste-test your way through the region's wine and cosy up in some of the country's very best hotels, before waking up and doing it all again.</p>

        <h5>Shark Bay, Australia</h5>
        <p>The most westerly point on mainland Australia is this UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was founded before Captain Cook discovered land at Botany Bay, with Dutch explorers touching down here in the 17th century. The area is diverse – there’s a beach made up entirely of tiny white shells, stromatolites on the shore of Hamelin Pool and the salt mine at Useless Loop, which produces the purest grade of salt in the world and is only accessible via four-by-four – or visible from the sky.</p>

        <h5>Paracas, Peru</h5>
        <p>A small seaside town in the Ica region of Peru, Paracas is where the desert meets the sea. A trip to the area isn’t complete without a boat ride to Islas Ballestas, the rocky islands off the Pacific coast known for their diverse wildlife including flocks of sea lions and crowds of baby penguins.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="5.jpg"><br>
        <h5>Algarve, Portugal</h5>
        <p>The red-cliff coastline and pristine whitewashed Moorish villages that dot the south-western region of Portugal have started shifting crowds away from the region’s busier hotspots. It has its own sunny microclimate and affordable places to stay such as Casa Mãe in Lagos make it a great winter-sun option too.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="6.jpg"><br>
        <h5>Paris, France</h5>
        <p>With its striking architecture, grand boulevards, world-class art, jewel-box patisseries and classic places to stay, this is a city that never sleeps. Its unrivalled food scene is best experienced by stumbling upon corner bistros down cobbled streets.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="7.jpg"><br>
        <h5>Hòa Bình, Vietnam</h5>
        <p>Vietnamese for peace, Hòa Bình province is located in the north of the country and is home to hill tribes including the Hmong, Muong and Dzao, plus endless rice fields.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="8.jpg"><br>
        <h5>Sarakiniko Beach, Milos, Greece</h5>
        <p>Off-radar Milos has some of the best beaches in the Aegean without the buzz of Mykonos or Santorini. Moon-like Sarakiniko is made up of mounds of undulating bone-white, wave-like volcanic rock and forms one of the island’s most mesmerising bays.</p>
